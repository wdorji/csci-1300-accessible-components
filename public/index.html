        <h1>Dropdown menus and a revised design</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          Dropdown menus are a staple of modern user interfaces, offering users
          a compact way to navigate options, select inputs, and execute
          commands. Despite their widespread use, not all dropdowns are created
          equal—some enhance usability, while others frustrate users with poor
          design choices. This article explores how dropdown menus are
          implemented across various applications, analyzing their effectiveness
          in terms of usability, accessibility, and efficiency. By rethinking
          dropdown interactions, we aim to create a more intuitive and
          accessible approach that balances functionality with ease of use.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples of dropdowns</h2>
        <p>
          To better understand how dropdown menus impact user experience, I
          examined three different applications—Reddit, Amazon, and the RTI
          International website—and how they implement this common UI element.
        </p>
        <h3>Reddit Communities Dropdown</h3>
        The dropdown allow users to quickly access and navigate between
        different subreddit communities. The menu holds a list of joined
        communities for easy discovery. The dropdown also supports favoriting
        communities (via a star icon) to prioritize frequently visited ones.

        <h3>Amazon Country/Region Dropdown</h3>
        The primary use is to let users select their current country or region
        for their shipping address.

        <h3>RTL International Navbar Dropdown</h3>
        The dropdown is used here within the nav bar to help users explore
        different sections of the RTL website efficiently.

        <h2>Evaluating Interaction Across Input Methods</h2>
        <p>
          When designing or evaluating user interfaces, it’s essential to
          consider how users interact with components using different input
          methods. A well-designed dropdown menu should be accessible and
          intuitive, whether someone is using a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen.
          To illustrate this, we’ve analyzed how each of the dropdown menus from
          above behave across three primary interaction modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mouse/Touchpad</strong> – The default mode for most desktop
            users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keyboard-Only Navigation</strong> – Essential for
            accessibility and efficiency, especially for power users and those
            who rely on assistive technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile/Touchscreen</strong> – Crucial for users on
            smartphones and tablets, where interactions are gesture-based.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The table below summarizes how each dropdown functions across these
          input methods:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/inputs_comparison.png"
            alt="Comparing between inputs"
            width="100%"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Comparing between applications based on each input menthods
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Every interaction with a UI component triggers an output which can a
          visual, textual, or hidden response that represents the component’s
          current state. These outputs help users understand whether an action
          was successful, whether an element is interactive, or what state a
          component is in at any given moment. Some outputs are purely visual,
          such as changes in color, opacity, border thickness, or a button
          appearing pressed when clicked. If an output is ambiguous or
          inconsistent across interaction types, it can lead to confusion and
          inefficiency in navigation. The table below summarizes how each
          dropdown visually and functionally represents its state across the
          different applications based on each interaction mode:
        </p>

        <figure>

            src="./images/outputs_comparison.png"
            alt="Comparing between outputs"
            width="100%"
          />

        <h2>Understanding state models for dropdowns</h2>

        <p>
          When designing interactive components, it's crucial to consider how
          they change based on user interactions. A state model helps us
          visualize the different conditions a component can be in and how users
          transition between them. In the previous section, we explored how
          different dropdown menus behave across mouse, keyboard, and touch
          inputs. Now, we’ll take a structured approach by defining two state
          models that outline how users interact specifically for the case of
          the Amazon dropdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first model will focus on how users interact with the dropdown
          using a mouse or touchpad—hovering, clicking, and navigating.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/states/mouse_amazon.png"
            alt="State model for mouse users"
            width="1000"
          />
          <figcaption>State model for mouse users</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The second model will focus on keyboard navigation, detailing how
          users move through the component using the Tab key, Enter key, and
          other shortcuts.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/states/key_amazon.png"
            alt="State model for keyboard users"
            width="1000"
          />
          <figcaption>State model for keyboard users</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Note that for the existing dropdown menu wile clicking the dropdown
        button works,the dropdown button itself is hidden. Also users must
        manually scroll through a long list of countries, and it is not
        intuitive that you can type when the dropdown is expanded to focus on
        the specifc country instead of scrolling. How about we add a search bar
        to allow users to filter and quickly select their country?

        <h2>Proposed Dropdown Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          In adding the search bar, we must now update out state models to
          account for the state of the search bar:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/states/re_mouse_amazon.png"
            alt="Revised state model for mouse users"
            width="1000"
          />
          <figcaption>Revised state model for mouse users</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/states/re_key_amazon.png"
            alt="Revised state model for keyboard users"
            width="1000"
          />
          <figcaption>Revised state model for keyboard users</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The revised state model introduces a significant improvement in
          efficiency for dropdown menus by incorporating a search bar at the top
          of the menu. This enhancement addresses the challenges of navigating
          long lists, such as country selections, by enabling users to type and
          filter options dynamically. It also enhances accessibility for users
          with motor impairments who may struggle with precise scrolling.
          However, this improvement comes at the cost of learnability—users
          unfamiliar with search-based dropdowns may not immediately realize
          they can type to filter results. Memorability could also be impacted,
          as users who do not frequently interact with the dropdown might forget
          about the search feature and default to manual scrolling. Balancing
          these factors ensures that the redesign is more user-friendly overall,
          but it still requires clear visual cues or instructions to accommodate
          all users effectively. See the Figma prototype below to see these
          enhancements:

        <h2>
          Observations on Usability and Accessibility in the Original Design
        </h2>

        <p>
          The original dropdown design supports basic mouse and keyboard
          interactions, ensuring users can navigate through the list using
          either input method. It includes visual feedback (e.g., button color
          changes) when hovering over options, aiding users in understanding
          their current focus. Users can navigate the dropdown using the Tab key
          and select options with Enter or Spacebar, adhering to basic
          accessibility standards. The design ensures focus is visible (e.g.,
          blue border) when navigating with a keyboard, which is critical for
          users with visual impairments. In redesigning the dropdown, I retained
          these strengths while improving efficiency and accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the original design, users must scroll through a long list to find
          their country/region. This poses a challenge for individuals with
          motor impairments who struggle with fine cursor movements or prolonged
          scrolling. Without a search feature, these users may experience
          frustration and difficulty selecting their preferred country quickly.
          An example of positive impact for accessibility, is that the original
          design supports basic keyboard navigation, allowing users to tab
          through elements and select options using the Enter or Spacebar keys.
          This benefits users with motor impairments who may rely on keyboards
          instead of a mouse. In terms of negative impact, users must scroll
          through a long list to find their country/region. This poses a
          challenge for individuals with motor impairments who struggle with
          fine cursor movements or prolonged scrolling. Without a search
          feature, these users may experience frustration and difficulty
          selecting their preferred option quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Accessibility Considerations Addressed in the Revised Design Search
        </h2>

        <p>
          In this
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8"> talk </a>,
          Holmes defines mismatch as a design failure where tools, systems, or
          environments exclude people because they don’t align with diverse
          human abilities. Mismatches arise from ability bias—designing for
          abilities similar to the designer’s own (e.g., motion-sensor toilets
          assume users can wave hands) and Holmes argues that resolving
          mismatches isn’t just about access but fostering belonging and
          innovation through intentional, inclusive design. The revised dropdown
          design, which incorporates a search bar, directly addresses a mismatch
          by reducing the disconnect between user abilities and the design of
          the dropdown menu. In its original form, the mismatch arises from
          assuming all users can efficiently interact with static, scroll-heavy
          lists. By introducing a search bar, the design accommodates users who
          struggle with fine motor control (e.g., due to tremors or
          disabilities) no longer need to scroll extensively or click repeatedly
          or type quickly to locate options. The original design also did not
          provide any visual focus indicators for keyboard users beyond the
          default browser styling.Typing into the search bar offers a more
          accessible way to locate options and the search bar simplifies the
          process by dynamically filtering results as they type. The redesign
          ensures that keyboard users can tab into the search bar and type their
          selection without needing to navigate through every option
          sequentially and allows screen readers to announce filtered results
          more effectively, reducing the need for exhaustive exploration of the
          list.
        </p>

        <h2>Prioritization of User Groups in Component Design</h2>

        <p>
          Among mouse, keyboard, touch/mobile, and screen reader users, mouse
          and touch/mobile users are typically prioritized when designing
          components. This is evident in how dropdowns are often optimized for
          clicking, tapping, and scrolling, rather than for structured keyboard
          navigation or robust screen reader support. This prioritization can
          negatively impact keyboard and screen reader users, making
          interactions more cumbersome. For example, if keyboard focus
          indicators are weak or missing, users navigating with the Tab key may
          struggle to determine where they are in the dropdown. Similarly, if a
          screen reader does not provide real-time feedback on dropdown state
          changes, visually impaired users might be unsure whether their input
          has been registered. By prioritizing only the most common interaction
          methods, components risk excluding users with disabilities, leading to
          frustration and accessibility barriers. A more inclusive design
          approach would ensure that all interaction methods—especially keyboard
          and screen reader navigation—are equally considered.
